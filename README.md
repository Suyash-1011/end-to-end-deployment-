## Introduction

This project aims to provide a foundational machine learning pipeline that includes:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model deployment

The primary focus is to build a robust, efficient, and scalable pipeline for a variety of machine learning tasks.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Insights and visualizations to understand data distributions.
- **Model Training**: Multiple algorithms with evaluation metrics.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search, Random search, and Bayesian optimization.
- **Model Deployment**: API endpoints for model predictions using Flask or FastAPI.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git
- Virtual environment (recommended: `venv` or `conda`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/krishnaik06/mlproject.git
    cd mlproject
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
   Open the desired notebook and follow the steps.

2. **Train the Model**:

   Modify and execute the training script:
   
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Deploy the Model**:

   Run the Flask/FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Access the API at `http://localhost:5000` or as specified in the script.
